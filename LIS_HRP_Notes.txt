Isses:

	Had to edit mavgen_cs.py, and common.xml to remove errors regenerating MAVLink custom classes.

	To get Custom MAVLink messages to appear in MP, need to copy they LIS_Logger.xml, edit ardupilotmega.xml to inculed and recomplie

	Errors in regenerate.bat (run in command line):
		Fix add paraths to print statments print(...) in mavgen_cs.py
		Manual removed bitmask=".." from 2 locations in common.xml

		regenerate.bat python error not module future

	VisualStudio 2019 16.7.5 Has issues showing CGSView WinForm Design pages which shows controls.
	Error in System.WinForm....
		Upgraded SKIASharp to latest version fixed it. But after upgrading SKIASHarp.Views to latest version got red X's in some controls.
		Down grading SKIASharp.view seems to resolve it...
